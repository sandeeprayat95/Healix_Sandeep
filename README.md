Added ASP.NET web application which connects to a MSSQL Server Database storing User data and serves the front end. 

The connection string has been left in to show the connection locally between my local server. Usually this would be removed for security concerns.

The Front end is an Angular web app which provides functionality as per the specification.

It Lists Users and Adds Users

The functionality is simple and has some basic CSS

Here are some things that I woud have added given more time but ran out of time during the 48 hours:

-Validation of requests to the backend and validation on the front end for non required fields  
-Exception handling for errors server side  
-Adding functionality to edit each user which will take you to the edit user page from the list users page.  
-Adding delete functionality to delete a specific user instead of just the current user from the add-user page.  
-Adding unit tests to fully cover the application  
-Updating the CSS to be a little more modern at the minute its quite basic in its design
